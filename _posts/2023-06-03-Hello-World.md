This is a blog post using the github pages system.  I would like to write more about this system if I had any idea what to write.  For now we will just need to accept that I'm a newb.

You might won't if a space between a line make a paragraph; yes it does and I'm hoping to show that now.
You might also won't if hitting return but not provideing a blank line is going to also be a paragraph;
nope!  Looks like you can
write as short as
you like if
the lines
are
together then they remain part of the same paragraph and will properly word-wrap with no regard to your crazy "enter" key activity.
This is a nice feature to keep things readable in the markdown code.

* next topic
* markdown code is easy

## sub-header again to show a new idea is about to drop
new idea here if you can stand watching me to type so slow.
